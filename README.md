# Binary Search Tree (BSTree)

This Ruby class implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with various functionalities, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing. It allows for efficient searching, sorting, and management of data.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add unique values to the tree.
- **Deletion**: Remove values while maintaining tree structure.
- **Traversal Methods**:
  - Pre-order (DLR)
  - In-order (LDR)
  - Post-order (LRD)
  - Level-order
- **Height Calculation**: Get the height of the tree or any subtree.
- **Depth Calculation**: Find the depth of a specific node.
- **Balanced Check**: Check if the tree is balanced.
- **Rebalance**: Convert the tree into a balanced BST.
- **Pretty Print**: Visual representation of the tree structure.
